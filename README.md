# Catalyst Team

The catalyst team are focused on helping Garage teams accelerate MVPs and production engagements using Kubernetes technology across public cloud and OpenShift. We are focusing on three areas:

1. *Iteration Zero*, how does a team create a development environment that will support their cloud native development needs using Kubernetes
2. *Activation*, help grow skills in key areas from TDD, Pact Testing, DevOps , etc and that project teams have the necessary skills to support the project
3. *Starter Kits*, provide a set of robust starter code to accelerate the project inception and initial architectural decisions
