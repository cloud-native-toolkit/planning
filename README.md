# IBM Garage for Cloud Developer Tools Planning Project

This project is focused on helping Garage teams accelerate MVPs and production engagements using Kubernetes technology across public cloud and OpenShift. We are focusing on three areas:

1. *Iteration Zero*, how does a team create a development environment that will support their cloud native development needs using Kubernetes
2. *Activation*, help grow skills in key areas from TDD, Pact Testing, DevOps , etc and that project teams have the necessary skills to support the project
3. *Starter Kits*, provide a set of robust starter code to accelerate the project inception and initial architectural decisions
4. Enable solution development with IBM Cloud Paks
5. Make cloud native development as easy as possible 
6. Introduce emerging technologies like Tekton, Solsa to Garage developers for use with projects 

Use this project to raise issues, manage epics , tasks and stories, use Zenhub to manage the Kanban board

# Iteration planning meetings

We will conduct weekly meetings to plan the stories that will be addressed for the week (and identify who will be available to work on issues during the week.) These meetings are open to anyone who would participate.
