# Contributing Garage Method content

The following gives the steps for how to provide content to the Garage Method site. https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/engagement/getStartedGM

Here's a quick overview:

1. Fork the content repo - https://github.ibm.com/cloudcontent/ibmmethod

2. Open an issue in the `cloudcontent/ibmmethod` repo with the title like - 
`PRACTICE: <title> , TUTORIAL: <title>, or GUIDED DEMO: <title>`.  The description must include:
    
    - `title`
    - `type of content`
    - `brief description`
    - `owner name`
    - `owner email address`
    - `where content should be linked`
    - `agreement to maintain content`
    
3. The Garage Method site team will add skeleton markdown files for the content to the repo and update the issue

4. Modify the skeleton markdown files with content in the forked repo and submit a pull request when it should be published
