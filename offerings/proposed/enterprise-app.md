This document will be a short paper on the differences between an MVP and an enterprise app, what is needed to make an MVP into a production quality app, how an project iterates to produce an MVP and then evolve that into a production-quality enterprise app.

Mission: Too many Garage projects end with developing an MVP. The Garage wants to deliver more projects that last all the way through production deployment of an enterprise app.
